A new invisible enemy, only 30kb in size, has emerged and is on a killing spree around the world: 2019-nCoV, the Novel Coronavirus!

This monitor was developed to make the data and key visualizations of COVID-19 trends available to everyone and also provide a platform to conduct a sentiment analysis of social media posts using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

This monitor has 3 tabs: Dashboard, Comparison and Sentiments. Dashboard allows user to view a complete picture of COVID-19 spread around the world. User can also click on any country in the map to view the numbers in that country. In Comparison tab user can compare the spread of COVID-19 in multiple countries in one view. Sentiment tab allows user to run a sentiment analysis of trending hashtags of coronavirus on social media.
